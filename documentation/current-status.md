# Current release and work

Updated 2026-10-29. This is the task/status source of truth; [architecture and decisions](how-the-app-works.md) owns product rules. Historical checkpoints do not override this page.

## Release

Before this cleanup: runtime `1e26fd66`, documentation `b0262e8c`, build `nSSn82C3vQTfih2hDr3HR`, green/3002, released October 29. Cleanup deployment evidence is recorded below after verification.

## Done

- One database: CRM public schema and Studio schema, canonical Location foreign keys, shared roles and realm authority. Runtime has no workspace/membership mirror dependency.
- Shared usage totals and fixed-script onboarding live. Totals are recorded application usage, not provider invoice reconciliation; missing historical usage is not guessed.
- Unified restore drill: 184 table inventories/digests, 83 migrations at snapshot time, zero invalid FKs, 471 media references. This predates the later tested profile migration; it is not a fresh restore of today's production.
- Removed workspace URL redirect/path helper and retired tenant-selection handler. Clean paths use active Location; old paths have no compatibility promise. Existing tenant-switch authorization and stale-command fences remain.

## Preserved recovery and data

`Location.studioWorkspaceId` is recovery metadata only (source-copy rehearsal still reads it), not runtime identity. Keep it until a separate backed-up, disposable-rehearsed migration preserves its map. Old source names/IDs in frozen SQL, import/recovery tools, receipt/checksums and immutable R2 media prefixes are intentional historical evidence. No content, records, media, backups, migration ledger or source project is deleted. All 471 old R2 keys remain unchanged. See [cutover](studio-merge-cutover.md) and [backup/restore](unified-database-recovery.md).

## Next three tasks / acceptance

1. **Open: final-build signed acceptance.** CRM ↔ Studio actual switches on both domains; signed core pages and mobile widths. Record final artifact and observed results, not earlier-build evidence.
2. **Open, requires device:** sustained existing Mac companion diagnostics/local processing. A prior no-provider once-mode job succeeded and exited cleanly; that does not prove sustained processing. Use existing pairing only.
3. **Blocked on bounded spend authorization:** real onboarding draft/review/save using a specified model and concrete cost ceiling. Mock/disposable access, persistence and ledger checks passed; no real provider run is authorized. Ask the parent for that decision before paid acceptance.

Website editing/publishing and Clerk email delivery have no new live acceptance in this cleanup. Do not publish, invite or send messages merely to test. Substo CRM setup-pending is intentionally deferred. Free-form onboarding/search, more social integrations, billing, custom domains and proxy work are deferred.

## Verify and release

- Focused routes/auth: `npx tsx --test lib/studio/route-context.test.ts lib/auth/tenant-context.test.ts lib/auth/host-routing-policy.test.ts`
- No-provider onboarding/usage/fetch checks: use existing suites in `lib/studio`, `lib/ai` and `lib/web`; never infer a real paid pass from mocks.
- Compiler: `npx tsc --noEmit` (known whole-project baseline failures; report affected-file diagnostics separately). Next build skips type validation.
- Production build/deploy: `PRISMA_SCHEMA_SYNC_MODE=migrate-only ./deploy-local-build.sh` with actual `.env.prod` and Caddyfile. The owned workflow builds, backs up, verifies dependencies/schema/readiness, switches Caddy, soaks and checks services. No Vercel; do not bypass gates or edit checksums.
- Public release checks: `curl -fsS https://estio.co/api/health` and `/api/version`; Substo health is host-policy 404, not a failed database check.
