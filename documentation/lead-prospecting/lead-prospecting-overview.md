# Lead Prospecting & AI CRM — Scope of Work
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-14
**Status:** Planning & Scoping

## 1. Vision

Evolve Estio from an internal CRM/property management platform into an **enterprise-grade AI real estate sales, marketing, and property management SaaS** capable of:

1. **Discovering** leads who are looking to rent, sale or to list, from external sources (Bazaraki, social media marketplaces and other listing portals)
2. **Qualifying** leads automatically with AI scoring and segmentation
3. **Engaging** leads through intelligent, multi-channel outreach campaigns
4. **Converting** leads through deal-room orchestration and AI-assisted negotiation
5. **Retaining** clients through ongoing market intelligence and proactive follow-ups

## 2. Current Platform Capabilities

> These capabilities have been reviewed from the existing codebase and documentation.

| Capability | Status | Key References |
|---|---|---|
| **Unified Contact Model** | ✅ Production | `contact-model-spec.md`, `prisma/schema.prisma` — Contact model with lead tracking, requirements, roles, gamification |
| **Lead Pipeline Fields** | ✅ Defined | `leadStage`, `leadPriority`, `leadGoal`, `leadSource`, `leadAssignedToAgent` on Contact |
| **AI Lead Scoring (Schema)** | ⚡ Schema only | `leadScore`, `qualificationStage`, `buyerProfile` fields exist but are **not yet wired up** |
| **Property Matching** | ✅ Basic | `requirement*` fields with matching preferences and notification frequency |
| **Scraping Infrastructure** | ✅ Legacy | Puppeteer-based CRM puller (`lib/crm/crm-puller.ts`), `ScrapeRule` model in Prisma |
| **XML Feed Ingestion** | ✅ Production | `PropertyFeed`, `FeedService`, feed wizard, feed inbox at `/admin/properties/feed-inbox` |
| **AI Autonomous Agent** | ✅ V3 | Planner-Executor system with tools: `update_requirements`, `search_properties`, `create_viewing`, `log_activity` |
| **AI Skills Runtime** | ✅ Production | `AiSkillPolicy`, `AiDecision`, `AiRuntimeJob`, `AiSuggestedResponse` — objectives: nurture, revive, listing_alert, deal_progress |
| **Conversations Hub** | ✅ Advanced | WhatsApp/Email/SMS, workspace v2, deal mode, real-time SSE, selection actions |
| **Multi-Tenant Public Sites** | ✅ Production | Lead capture forms, SEO infrastructure, saved searches, property galleries |
| **Deal Rooms** | ✅ Production | `DealContext`, `Offer`, `DealDocument`, unified timeline, participant routing |
| **Team Management** | ✅ Production | RBAC, invite system, GHL sync, onboarding gate |

### Identified Gaps

| Gap | Needed For |
|---|---|
| No **visual pipeline board** (Kanban) | Agent productivity — managing leads visually |
| No **Lead Inbox / Prospecting Queue** | Triaging newly discovered leads before CRM entry |
| Lead scoring schema exists but is **dormant** | Cannot auto-prioritize leads |
| No **Outreach Campaign** model | Cannot run systematic first-contact sequences |
| No **Social Media** connector layer | Cannot discover leads from Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn |
| No **Listing Monitor** for competitive analysis | Cannot track market supply or approach owners proactively |
| No **structured source metadata** | Cannot attribute and measure lead acquisition channels |

## 4. Enterprise SaaS Principles

All features follow these core principles already established in the Estio platform:

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Multi-tenancy** | All models scoped by `locationId`; data isolation enforced server-side |
| **Role-based access** | Prospecting admin features restricted via `UserLocationRole` checks |
| **Audit trail** | `ContactHistory` for lead lifecycle; `SettingsAuditLog` for config changes |
| **AI human-in-the-loop** | All AI-generated outreach goes through `AiSuggestedResponse` approval queue |
| **Compliance** | Quiet hours, consent tracking, opt-out, GDPR via `AiSkillPolicy.compliancePolicy` |
| **Scalability** | Cursor pagination, delta polling, SSE real-time — production-proven patterns |
| **Observability** | `AgentExecution` traces, cost tracking, performance instrumentation |
