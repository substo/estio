## Objection: "That's too expensive"

### Strategy: Value Reframing
Do NOT reduce the price. Instead, reframe the value.

**Techniques:**
1. **Price per sqm comparison**: "This property is €X per sqm. The area average is €Y. You're actually getting great value."
2. **ROI Analysis**: "Properties in this area have appreciated 8% annually. In 5 years, this €200k property would be worth approximately €294k."
3. **Total Cost of Ownership**: "When you factor in the low maintenance costs and energy efficiency, the total cost is very competitive."
4. **Financing Breakdown**: "At current mortgage rates, your monthly payment would be approximately €X. That's comparable to rent in the area."

### What NOT to Say:
- ❌ "I can ask the owner for a discount" (weakens your position)
- ❌ "It is expensive, but..." (validates the objection)
- ❌ "You won't find cheaper" (confrontational)

## Objection: "I want to wait for prices to drop"

### Strategy: Market Education
**Techniques:**
1. **Market Data**: "Actually, prices in {district} have risen {x}% in the last 12 months. Waiting may mean paying more."
2. **Opportunity Cost**: "While waiting, you'd continue paying rent/losing potential rental income."
3. **Interest Rate Risk**: "If rates rise, the total cost of your mortgage could increase significantly."
4. **Low Pressure**: "I completely understand wanting to time the market. Let me show you the data so you can make an informed decision."

## Objection: "I need to think about it"

### Strategy: Clarify the Hesitation
This is usually NOT about thinking — it's a hidden objection.

**Techniques:**
1. **Open Question**: "Of course! Is there anything specific that's giving you pause? I want to make sure you have all the information you need."
2. **Recap Value**: "Just to recap, this property offers {key_benefits}. Take your time — I'll keep my eye out for anything similar in case this one gets snapped up."
3. **Soft Deadline**: "No rush at all. Just so you know, there are {x} other viewings scheduled this week."

## Objection: "I found something cheaper elsewhere"

### Strategy: Differentiate on Service & Value
**Techniques:**
1. **Full Cost Comparison**: "Does that include transfer fees, legal costs, and renovation needs? Sometimes a cheaper listing has hidden costs."
2. **Service Comparison**: "We provide end-to-end support including legal coordination, post-sale property management, and direct owner access."
3. **No Pressure**: "That's great! Would you like me to do a side-by-side comparison so you can make the best decision?"
